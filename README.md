🚦 **Analyzing Road Accidents with Excel!** 🚦  

Road safety is a crucial issue, and **data can help us understand accident trends, locations, and causes** to make better decisions. To explore this, I built an **interactive Road Accident Dashboard in Microsoft Excel** that provides key insights into accident patterns.  

🔹 **What does this dashboard do?**  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Dynamic charts and graphs to represent accident data  
✅ **Filterable Reports** – Easily filter by **year, location, vehicle type, and accident type**  
✅ **Trend Analysis** – See how accident rates change over time  

🔹 **How it’s built**  
📊 **Microsoft Excel** – For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation  
⚙️ **Power Query** – For data cleaning and transformation  
📂 **Data Source** – Open government datasets on accidents, locations, and severity  

💡 This project showcases how **Excel is still a powerful tool for data analytics** and can help in **real-world problem-solving**.
